    "### What We Practiced\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identifying Seasonality**: Visual analysis and seasonal decomposition\n",
    "2. **Seasonal Differencing**: $(1-L^s)$ operator to remove seasonal patterns\n",
    "3. **ACF/PACF Analysis**: Pattern recognition at seasonal lags\n",
    "4. **SARIMA Modeling**: Fitting and comparing different specifications\n",
    "5. **Diagnostics**: Residual analysis for seasonal models\n",

    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- Multiplicative seasonality → use log transformation\n",
    "- Often need both d=1 and D=1 for stationarity\n",
    "- The airline model SARIMA(0,1,1)(0,1,1)[12] is remarkably robust\n",
    "- ACF/PACF show patterns at seasonal lags (12, 24, 36, ...)\n",
    "- Always validate with residual diagnostics before forecasting"
